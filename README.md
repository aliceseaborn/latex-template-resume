# Latex Template - Resume

A professional and open-source resume format written in LaTeX. For non-LaTeX users, software such as [TexMaker](https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/) is highly recommended. Otherwise, this resume was rendered in TeX Live 2020/Debian. To render from the command line, simply run `make`.
